# Calculator
This project is a round 2 attempt to master JS fundamentals. Make a simple calculator with an enchanting GUI courtesy of HTML and CSS. 
The required functions will include, input-pair operations, basic operations, a clear button, operate button (=), decimal input, keyboard support, and very importantly a condescending message if the user attempts to break the app by dividing by zero. 

After the basic functionalities are handled, it'll be CSS'ified for some extra practice and submitted as a solution on TOP.
